# FAKE AND REAL NEWS DETECTION

Fake news refers to false or misleading information that is presented as if it were real news.This project aims to use ML modles to detect fake news based on the text of the article.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The challenge is to develop an effective  system that can automatically detect fake news and distinguish it from genuine news articles.

The ultimate goal is to prevent the spread of fake news and promote the dissemination of accurate information




## FRONT END
